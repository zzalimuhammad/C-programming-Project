# C programming Project
 
Hello everyone, I would like to share with you the latest project I did. The project revolves around data structures and different types of data. The project focuses on preparing an environment and creating a database for students and controlling it (add. delete. display. statistics...). The programming code was created using the C programming language.. It was a new challenge and I loved it because it covers a practical application in practice. I expect that access for admins only and many other features will be added in the future.
